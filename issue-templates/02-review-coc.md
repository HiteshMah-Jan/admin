Review the Code of Conduct
```
## Body


```md
We've provided a draft Code of Conduct for you that includes the contact information you provided for reporting purposes. Please ensure that these contact details are correct.

Please close this issue after  **all** chapter organizers have reviewed the CoC thoroughly and confirmed they are comfortable enforcing it.

(This will need to be done before we can list your chapter on our website.)

```md
**Optional:** Our tutorials are currently all in English, but If you decide that you'll be conducting your chapter events and repo discussions in a language other than English, you are welcome to update your Code of Conduct to the appropriate language. What's used right now is a custom Code of Conduct that mixes the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) ([see available translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations)) with the [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/) ([see available translations](https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com)) to ensure it covers interactions both online and at events.
