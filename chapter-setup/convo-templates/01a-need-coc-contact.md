# Convo Template: Need contact details for Code of Conduct

Select the appropriate template and replace ORGANIZER with the relevant GitHub handle(s).

## Multiple organizers:

```md
Thank you so much for volunteering to lead a local ProtoSchool chapter, @ORGANIZER @ORGANIZER!

One of your responsibilities as chapter organizers will be to administer your chapter's Code of Conduct. Can you please provide me with the contact information you'd like used if a chapter member needs to report a violation of that CoC? Some chapters create a central gmail account for the organizers to share for this purpose, while others list multiple individual contacts.

Once I have that contact info, I'll start working on setting up a chapter repo for you.
```

## Single organizer:

```md
Thank you so much for volunteering to lead a local ProtoSchool chapter, @ORGANIZER!

One of your responsibilities as chapter organizer will be to administer your chapter's Code of Conduct. Can you please provide me with the contact information you'd like used if a chapter member needs to report a violation of that CoC? Some chapters use a personal email account and some create a central gmail account that can be shared by multiple organizers as the chapter grows.

Once I have that contact info, I'll start working on setting up a chapter repo for you.
