@ORGANIZER @ORGANIZER Thanks for submitting the pull request to add your chapter to our website. I've just merged the PR, so you should see your chapter appear within the next 10 minutes at https://proto.school/#/chapters.

Should you decide in the future to add a website for your chapter (which you can easily do from your repo with GitHub Pages), please be sure to update the `chapters.json` file to include a `website` field with your website URL. This will update the link in our chapter listings.

I'll close this issue now, but don't hesitate to reach out with questions.
