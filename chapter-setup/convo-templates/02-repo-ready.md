@ORGANIZER @ORGANIZER Thanks for volunteering to organize a local chapter!

I've set up a basic [`CHAPTER` repo](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/CHAPTER) for you and given you admin privileges. (If you haven't already seen the invite, please visit https://github.com/ProtoSchool/CHAPTER/invitations.) I've also added you to our `chapter-organizers` team and the `CHAPTER` team you can use to communicate with your members.

Please see the [issue queue](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/CHAPTER/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc) in your chapter repo for a few final steps that need to be taken in order to get your repo finalized and your chapter listed on our website.  Once those steps are complete, we'll close out this setup issue.
